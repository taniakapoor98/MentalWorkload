The created system will allow users to upload EEG data files in .mat or .csv format. Band power features are then extracted from the raw EEG data which are then sent for backend processing where machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model analyses the uploaded EEG data to assess the individual's mental workload. The assessed mental workload—categorized as low, medium, or high—will be displayed on the interface. This system will provide both binary (low, high) and multiclass (low, medium, high) classifications of mental workload.
